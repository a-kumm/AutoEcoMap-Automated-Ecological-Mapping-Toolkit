# Automated Land Cover and Friction Map Generation for Ecological Modeling

This repository provides a fully automated pipeline to generate **land cover maps (LCC)** and **friction maps** from multiple geospatial datasets (IGN BD TOPO, OCS GE, RPG, RGE ALTI, etc.).
The workflow was designed for ecological modeling, with a focus on **landscape connectivity analysis** (e.g., for *Cervus elaphus* / red deer), but can be adapted for other ecological studies.

The pipeline integrates:

* Vector preprocessing of multiple sources (land use, hydrography, vegetation, transport networks, buildings, fences, etc.).
* Automated merging of datasets across multiple departments or regions.
* Rasterization of land cover classes at a chosen resolution.
* Derivation of friction maps based on land cover, slope (DTM), and distance to built-up areas.
* Scenario-based post-processing (e.g., with/without fences or infrastructures).

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Prepare input datasets**
   Place the required IGN datasets (BD TOPO, OCS GE, RPG, RGE ALTI) in the `base_dir` defined in `config.py`.
   The code automatically detects which departments/regions intersect the study area.

2. **Set study area**
   Define your study area in `config.py` (either by name or by providing a shapefile).

3. **Run the pipeline**
   Example with the test script:

   ```bash
   python test_main.py
   ```

   This will:

   * Clip and preprocess all layers to the study area.
   * Merge vector layers from multiple departments if necessary.
   * Generate two rasters:

     * **Land cover map** (raw classes)
     * **Friction map** (landscape permeability, with slope and building distance weighting)

4. **Output**
   Results are stored in the `OUTPUT` directory (path set in `config.py`):

   * `landcover.tif` ‚Üí Land cover map (GeoTIFF, 5m resolution by default)
   * `friction.tif` ‚Üí Friction map (GeoTIFF, 5m resolution by default)

## üß© Scenarios

The pipeline supports scenario-based ecological modeling by modifying friction values:

* **Full scenario** ‚Üí All obstacles (fences, transport infrastructures) considered.
* **No fences** ‚Üí Fence friction values neutralized.
* **No permeability** ‚Üí Obstacles considered impassable.
* **Custom** ‚Üí User-defined modifications.

Scenarios are applied in **post-processing** from the main friction raster.

Would you like me to also create a **`requirements.txt`** file from your code (extracting the imports), so that the `README` links directly to it? That way, users can just `pip install -r requirements.txt` without guessing dependencies.
